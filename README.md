## Installation

1. Copy the files to your web server
2. Make sure PHP can create new files in that path
3. Open the file in your browser

You should use Freelance Timetracker locally since there is no password protection and everyone could access it.

## Tutorial

Change the rate of your task and click the checkbox to start timing it.

## How it works

The code is just a PHP and a JSON file. Uses Twitter Bootstrap for the UI and JS/AJAX/JSON to send the information (every 10 seconds by default) to the back-end. The PHP back-end then saves everything into a file which makes it easy to move around and edit.
